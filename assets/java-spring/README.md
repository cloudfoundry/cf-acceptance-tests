# Spring Boot Trivial App

This contains the built JAR, and the source code for a trivial SpringBoot app.

The app has one feature which is to return `ok`.

The source code is included so that future consumers of this app can make modifications.

A pre-built JAR is included so that no Java toolchain is needed when running cats.

## Building

The application JAR can be rebuilt by running `mvn package` provided a JDK and Maven are installed.

## Context

The app is build using SpringBoot 3.1.2, following the instructions found
[here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.1.2/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started.first-application).
