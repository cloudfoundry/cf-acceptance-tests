# CF Acceptance Tests (CATs)

This test suite exercises a full [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release) deployment using the golang `cf` CLI and `curl`.  It is restricted to testing user-facing features such as a user interacting with the system via the CLI.

For example, one test pushes an app with `cf push`, hits an endpoint on the app with `curl` that causes it to crash, and asserts that we eventually see a crash event registered in `cf events`.

Tests that will NOT be introduced here are ones which could be tested at the component level, such as basic CRUD of an object in the Cloud Controller. These tests belong with that component.

These tests are not intended for use against production systems, they are intended for acceptance environments for teams developing Cloud Foundry itself.  While these tests attempt to clean up after themselves, there is no guarantee that they will not mutate state of your system in an undesirable way.  For lightweight system tests that are safe to run against a production environment, please use the [CF Smoke Tests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-smoke-tests).

NOTE: Because we want to parallelize execution, tests should be written in such a way as to be runnable individually.  This means that tests should not depend on state in other tests, and should not modify the CF state in such a way as to impact other tests.

## Test Setup

### Pre-Requisites for running CATS

- Install golang >= 1.6. Set up your golang development environment, per
[golang.org](http://golang.org/doc/install).
- Install preferred SCM program in order to `go get` source code.
  * [git](http://git-scm.com/)
  * [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)
  * [bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/)
- Install the [`cf CLI`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli).
  Make sure that it is accessible in your `$PATH`.
- Install [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)
- Check out a copy of `cf-acceptance-tests` and make sure that it is added to your `$GOPATH`.
  The recommended way to do this is to run:

  ```bash
  go get -d github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests
  ```
  You will receive a warning `no buildable Go source files`; this can be ignored as there is no compilable go source code in the package, only test code.  - Ensure all submodules are checked out to the correct SHA.
  The easiest way to do this is by running:

  ```bash
  ./bin/update_submodules
  ```
- Install a running Cloud Foundry deployment to run these acceptance tests against. For example, bosh-lite.

### Updating `go` dependencies

All `go` dependencies required by CATs are vendored in the `vendor` directory.

Install [gvt](https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt) and make sure it is available
in your $PATH. The recommended way to do this is to run:
```bash
go get -u github.com/FiloSottile/gvt
```

In order to update a current dependency to a specific version,
do the following:

```bash
cd cf-acceptance-tests
gvt delete <import_path>
gvt fetch -revision <revision_number> <import_path>
```

If you'd like to add a new dependency just `gvt fetch`

## Test Configuration

You must set an environment variable `$CONFIG` which points to a JSON file that contains several pieces of data that will be used to configure the acceptance tests, e.g. telling the tests how to target your running Cloud Foundry deployment and what tests to run.

You can see all available config keys [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests/blob/master/helpers/config/config_struct.go#L15-L76) and their defaults [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests/blob/master/helpers/config/config_struct.go#L96-L149).

The following can be pasted into a terminal and will set up a sufficient `$CONFIG` to run the core test suites against a [BOSH-Lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) deployment of CF.

```bash
cat > integration_config.json <<EOF
{
  "api": "api.bosh-lite.com",
  "apps_domain": "bosh-lite.com",
  "admin_user": "admin",
  "admin_password": "admin",

#### Persistent App Test Setup
The tests in `one_push_many_restarts_test.go` operate on an app that is supposed to persist between runs of the CF Acceptance tests. If these tests are run, they will create an org, space, and quota and push the app to this space. The test config will provide default names for these entities, but to configure them, set values for `persistent_app_host`, `persistent_app_space`, `persistent_app_org`, and `persistent_app_quota_name`.

#### Buildpack Names
Many tests specify a buildpack when pushing an app, so that on diego the app staging process completes in less time. The default names for the buildpacks are as follows; if you have buildpacks with different names, you can override them by setting different names:

* `staticfile_buildpack_name: staticfile_buildpack`
* `java_buildpack_name: java_buildpack`
* `ruby_buildpack_name: ruby_buildpack`
* `nodejs_buildpack_name: nodejs_buildpack`
* `go_buildpack_name: go_buildpack`
* `python_buildpack_name: python_buildpack`
* `php_buildpack_name: php_buildpack`
* `binary_buildpack_name: binary_buildpack`

#### Route Services Test Group Setup

The `route_services` test group pushes applications which must be able to reach the load balancer of your Cloud Foundry deployment. This requires configuring application security groups to support this. Your deployment manifest should include the following data if you are running the `route_services` group:

```yaml
...
properties:
  ...
  cc:
    ...
    security_group_definitions:
      - name: load_balancer
        rules:
        - protocol: all
          destination: IP_OF_YOUR_LOAD_BALANCER # (e.g. 10.244.0.34 for a standard deployment of Cloud Foundry on BOSH-Lite)
    default_running_security_groups: ["load_balancer"]
```

#### Private Docker
To run tests that exercise the use of credentials to access a private docker registry, the `include_private_docker_registry` flag must be true, and the following config values must be provided:

* `private_docker_registry_image`
* `private_docker_registry_username`
* `private_docker_registry_password`

These tests assume that the specified private docker image is a private version of the cloudfoundry/diego-docker-app-custom:latest. To upload a private version to your DockerHub account, first create a private repository on DockerHub and log in to docker on the command line. Then run the following commands:

```bash
docker pull cloudfoundry/diego-docker-app-custom:latest
docker tag cloudfoundry/diego-docker-app-custom:latest <your-private-repo>:<some-tag>
docker push <your-private-repo>:<some-tag>
```

The value for the `private_docker_registry_image` config value in this case would be "<your-private-repo>:<some-tag>".

#### Capturing Test Output
When a test fails, look for the test group name (`[services]` in the example below) in the test output:

```bash
• Failure in Spec Setup (BeforeEach) [34.662 seconds]
[services] Service Instance Lifecycle
```

If you set a value for `artifacts_directory` in your `$CONFIG` file, then you will be able to capture `cf` trace output from failed test runs, this output may be useful in cases where the normal test output is not enough to debug an issue.  The `cf` trace output for the tests in these specs will be found in `CF-TRACE-Applications-*.txt` in the `artifacts_directory`.

## Test Execution
To execute all test groups, run the following from the root directory of cf-acceptance-tests:
```bash
./bin/test
```

##### Parallel execution
To execute all test groups, and have tests run in parallel across four processes one would run:

```bash
./bin/test -nodes=4
```

Be careful with this number, as it's effectively "how many apps to push at once", as nearly every example pushes an app.


##### Focusing Test Groups
If you are already familiar with CATs you probably know that there are many test groups. You may not wish to run all the tests in all contexts, and sometimes you may want to focus individual test groups to pinpoint a failure. To execute a specific group of acceptance tests, e.g. `routing/`, edit your [`integration_config.json`](#test-configuration) file and set all `include_*` values to `false` except for `include_routing` then run the following:

```bash
./bin/test
```

To execute tests in a single file use an `FDescribe` block around the tests in that file:
```go
var _ = BackendCompatibilityDescribe("Backend Compatibility", func() {
  FDescribe("Focused tests", func() { // Add this line here
  // ... rest of file
  }) // Close here
})

```

The test group names correspond to directory names.

##### Verbose Output
To see verbose output from `ginkgo`, use the `-v` flag.

```bash
./bin/test -v
```

You can of course combine the `-v` flag with the `-nodes=N` flag.

## Explanation of Test Groups

Test Group Name| Compatible Backend | Description
--- | --- | ---
`apps`| DEA or Diego | Tests the core functionalities of Cloud Foundry: staging, running, logging, routing, buildpacks, etc.  This test group should always pass against a sound Cloud Foundry deployment.
`backend_compatibility` | Diego | Tests interoperability of droplets staged on the DEAs running on Diego
`detect` | DEA or Diego | Tests the ability of the platform to detect the correct buildpack for compiling an application if no buildpack is explicitly specified.
`docker`| Diego |Test our ability to run docker containers on diego and that we handle docker metadata correctly.
`internet_dependent`| DEA or Diego | This test group tests the feature of being able to specify a buildpack via a Github URL.  As such, this depends on your Cloud Foundry application containers having access to the Internet.  You should take into account the configuration of the network into which you've deployed your Cloud Foundry, as well as any security group settings applied to application containers.
`routing`| DEA or Diego |This package contains routing specific acceptance tests (Context path, wildcard, SSL termination, sticky sessions, zipkin tracing).
`route_services` | Diego |This package contains route services acceptance tests.
`security_groups`| DEA or Diego |This test group tests the security groups feature of Cloud Foundry that lets you apply rules-based controls to network traffic in and out of your containers.  These should pass for most recent Cloud Foundry installations.  `cf-release` versions `v200` and up should have support for most security group specs to pass.
`services`| DEA or Diego | This test group tests various features related to services, e.g. registering a service broker via the service broker API.  Some of these tests exercise special integrations, such as Single Sign-On authentication; you may wish to run some tests in this package but selectively skip others if you haven't configured the required integrations.
`ssh`| Diego |This test group tests our ability to communicate with Diego apps via ssh, scp, and sftp.
`v3`| Diego| This test group contains tests for the next-generation v3 Cloud Controller API.  As of this writing, the v3 API is not officially supported.
`isolation_segments` | Diego | This test group requires that Diego be deployed with a minimum of 2 cells. One of those cells must have been deployed with a `placement_tag`. Additionally, a minimum of two Gorouter instances must be deployed. One instance must be configured with the property `routing_table_sharding_mode: shared-and-segments`. The other instance must have the properties `routing_table_sharding_mode: segments` and `isolation_segments: [YOUR_PLACEMENT_TAG_HERE]`. The `isolation_segment_name` in the CATs properties must match the `placement_tag` and `isolation_segment`. Finally, the `isolation_segment_domain` must be set and traffic to that domain should go to the isolation router.

## Contributing

This repository uses [gvt](https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt) to manage `go` dependencies.

All `go` dependencies required by CATs are vendored in the `vendor` directory.

When making changes to the test suite that bring in additional `go` packages,
you should use the workflow described in the
[gvt documentation](https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt#basic-usage).

### Code Conventions

There are a number of conventions we recommend developers of CF acceptance tests
adopt:

1. When pushing an app:
  * set the **backend**,
  * set the **memory** requirement, and use the suite's `DEFAULT_MEMORY_LIMIT` unless the test specifically needs to test a different value,
  * set the **buildpack** unless the test specifically needs to test the case where a buildpack is unspecified, and use one of `config.RubyBuildpack`, `config.JavaBuildpack`, etc.
unless the test specifically needs to use a buildpack name or URL specific to the test,
  * set the **domain**, and use the `Config.AppsDomain` unless the test specifically needs to test a different app domain.

  For example:

  ```go
  Expect(cf.Cf("push", appName,
      "--no-start"                          // don't start before setting backend
      "-b", buildpackName,                  // specify buildpack
      "-m", DEFAULT_MEMORY_LIMIT,           // specify memory limit
      "-d", Config.AppsDomain,              // specify app domain
  ).Wait(Config.DefaultTimeoutDuration())).To(Exit(0))

  //use the config-file specified backend when starting this app
  app_helpers.SetBackend(appName)

  Expect(cf.Cf("start", appName).Wait(Config.CfPushTimeoutDuration())).To(Exit(0))
  ```
1. Delete all resources that are created, e.g. apps, routes, quotas, etc.  This is in order to leave the system in the same state it was found in.  For example, to delete apps and their associated routes:
    ```
		Expect(cf.Cf("delete", myAppName, "-f", "-r").Wait(Config.DefaultTimeoutDuration())).To(Exit(0))
    ```
1. Specifically for apps, before tearing them down, print the app guid and recent application logs. There is a helper method `AppReport` provided in the `app_helpers` package for this purpose.

    ```go
    AfterEach(func() {
      app_helpers.AppReport(appName, Config.DefaultTimeoutDuration())
    })
    ```
1. Document the purpose of your test groups in this repo's README.md.  This is especially important when changing the explicit behavior of existing test groups or adding new test groups.
1. Document all changes to the config object in this repo's README.md.
1. Document the compatible backends in this repo's README.md.
1. If you add a test that requires a new minimum `cf` CLI version, update the `minCliVersion` in `cats_suite_test.go`.
1. If you add a test that is unsupported on a particular backend, add a ginkgo Skip() in an if Config.Backend != "your_backend" {} clause, [see Ginkgo's skip](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#the-spec-runner).
